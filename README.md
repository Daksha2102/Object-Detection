# object-detection
Project Description
This Object Detection project is designed to facilitate the detection of various objects within images using Python. It leverages computer vision techniques to identify and classify objects, making it suitable for applications in areas such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and image analysis.

Repository Structure
The repository contains the following key components:
Python Scripts:

main.py: The main script for executing the object detection functionality.
food_facts.py: A script that may contain functions related to detecting and analyzing food items in images.

Images:

cars.jpeg: An example image that may be used for testing the object detection capabilities.
fruit.jpeg: Another example image for similar purposes.

Configuration Files:

misc.xml, modules.xml, vcs.xml: XML files that likely contain configuration settings for the project.
count_cars.iml: An IntelliJ project file, indicating that the project may have been developed in an IDE.

Additional Folders:

__pycache__: Contains cached bytecode files for Python scripts.
inspectionProfiles: A folder that may include profiles or settings for inspection-related tasks.
sounds: A folder that may contain sound files related to the project.

This Object Detection project serves as a foundational tool for those interested in exploring computer vision and object detection techniques.
